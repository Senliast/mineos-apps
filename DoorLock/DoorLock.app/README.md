# About
A lock that supports code or fingerprint. You can configure output of a
redstone signal on different sites depending on if the authentication
failed or succeeded and an auto-lock timer.

This app is reborn of the CodeDoor app on older MineOS versions with some more
functions additionally. CodeDoor uses old libraries that doesnt work on new
MineOS versions (at least, officially) and is therefore not available anymore.
This app changes it.
